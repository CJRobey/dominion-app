# dominion-app
A tool for choosing good games of dominion


# TODO
Make the application user-interactive (what games, etc) - maybe create a conf file that gets set the first time, but then can be edited
Make this mobile friendly (don't have a clue how to do that)
Have images of each character pull up when the final decisions have been made.
